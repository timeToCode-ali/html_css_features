            <h3>Margarita</h3>
            <p>
              A margarita is a cocktail consisting of Tequila, triple sec, and lime juice often
              served with salt on the rim of the glass. The drink is served shaken with ice (on the
              rocks), blended with ice (frozen margarita), or without ice (straight up). The drink
              is generally served in a stepped-diameter variant of a cocktail glass or champagne
              coupe called a margarita glass.

            <h3>Mojito</h3>
            <p>
              Mojito is a traditional Cuban punch. The cocktail often consists of five ingredients:
              white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, soda water, and mint.
              Its combination of sweetness, citrus, and herbaceous mint flavours is intended to
              complement the rum, and has made the mojito a popular summer drink.

            <p>
              The piña colada (/ˌpiːnjə koʊˈlɑːdə, -nə-, -kə-/;[1][2] Spanish: piña [ˈpiɲa],
              "pineapple", and colada [koˈlaða], "strained") is a cocktail made with rum, cream of
              coconut or coconut milk, and pineapple juice, usually served either blended or shaken
              with ice. It may be garnished with either a pineapple wedge, maraschino cherry, or
              both. There are two versions of the drink, both originating in Puerto Rico.

              The daiquiri is a cocktail whose main ingredients are rum, citrus juice (typically
